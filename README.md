# HackerRank Challenge

This is a Simple Exercise to complete within 1hr 30 minutes. And to make sure the project runs and all the functionality works as expected. Following best practices or design, guidelines are not the scope of this exercise. 

Exercise:

Two Activities one for Login and Register and another for showing welcome user after Login/Register

The main task is to to do all the validation for Name, Emil, Password, Phone before Registering or Login.

When the account is created we have to save the information in the database. (for now, I was just using Shared Preference to save the detail including password)

The requirement was to not to change any of the existing code so, I just developed everything on top of it.
